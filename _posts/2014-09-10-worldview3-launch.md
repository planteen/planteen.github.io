After almost two years at Ball Aerospace, a spacecraft I worked on has launched!

To get an idea of the size of WorldView-3, notice the person in the background for scale.

Now when the faring is staked on the launch vehicle, an Atlas V, the height is
188 feet (19 stories)!

WV-1 was making a pass as WV-3 was launching and imaged the event from a
somewhat oblique angle from T+17 sec to T+95 sec.

A special beer was brewed by Oskar Blues to commemorate the launch.
