After almost two years at Ball Aerospace, finally a spacecraft I worked on has
launched!

To get an idea of the size of WorldView-3, look at this photo of it being
loaded into the fairing (nose cone). The spacecraft is 19 feet tall and notice
the person in the background for scale.

Now when the faring is staked on the launch vehicle, an Atlas V, the height is
188 feet (19 stories)!

WorldView-3 (WV-3) was built for DigitalGlobe. DigitalGlobe supplies satellite
imagery to Google Maps and Bing Maps. So you may have already used some imagery
from Digital Globeâ€™s other satellites, such WorldView-2 (WV-2) or WorldView-1
(WV-1) both of which were also built by Ball. Fortuitously, WV-1 was making a
pass as WV-3 was launching and imaged the event from a somewhat oblique angle
from T+17 sec to T+95 sec.

A special beer was brewed by Oskar Blues to commemorate the launch.
