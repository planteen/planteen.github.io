After almost two years at Ball Aerospace, finally a spacecraft I worked on has
launched! Not to say the length of time was abnormal -- building a large
satellite is an activity that takes years. Nearly everything has to be right
since there is no fixing the hardware once it is in space. I spent many hours
sitting a few yards from the spacecraft, peering at it through a window into
the cleanroom.

To get an idea of the size of WorldView-3, look at this photo of it being
loaded into the fairing (nose cone). The spacecraft is 19 feet tall and notice
the person in the background for scale.

Now when the faring is staked on the launch vehicle, an Atlas V, the height is
188 feet (19 stories)!

WorldView-3 (WV-3) was built for DigitalGlobe. DigitalGlobe supplies satellite
imagery to Google Maps and Bing Maps. So you may have already used some imagery
from Digital Globe’s other satellites, such WorldView-2 (WV-2) or WorldView-1
(WV-1) both of which were also built by Ball. Fortuitously, WV-1 was making a
pass as WV-3 was launching and imaged the event from a somewhat oblique angle
from T+17 sec to T+95 sec. Keep in mind that the ground track speed of WV-1 is
over 4.5 miles per second.

A special beer was brewed by Oskar Blues to commemorate the launch.

WV-3 has the highest resolution (0.31 m) of any commercial satellite currently
on-orbit. Thanks to relaxed government restriction, DigitalGlobe will be able
to release pictures at the maximum resolution in a few months. I can’t for
imagery to become available and use it to hunt for caves from space!
