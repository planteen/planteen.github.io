I went on an expedition to a remote area of Peru in 2010 to find and explore
virgin alpine caves. A group of cavers returned in 2014 to continue the
exploration project. The 2014 Peru caving expedition veterans consisted of me
(Cody Planteen), Mike Green, and Brian Gindling. Participants new to Peru
included Jared Habiak, Elliot Stahl, Peter Hartley, and Chris Higgins. We spent
18 days in July 2014 camped at over 14,000 feet. Even though Peru is near the
equator and we were there during the “dry” season, the trip was a bit cold! The
temperature got below freezing most nights. We also had plenty of rain,
drizzle, sleet, and even a little snow.

The majority of our time was spent ridgewalking in steep and sometimes
difficult terrain. One of the highlights discovered on the expedition was Cueva
del Sismo (Earthquake Cave), a nice formation cave. It was named for all the
signs of seismic activity, including many broken formations and cracked
columns.

Another highlight was Grieta de Asfixia, a multi-drop vertical cave nearly
1,000 feet deep.

We found and explored dozens of other pits. Most pits were blind, some led to
passage, and a few had beautiful formations.

I love the feeling of being the first person ever to explore and see a cave,
though it does feel nice to get back to showers, sleeping indoors, and the
English language! More details, such as cave maps and narratives, will be
published in upcoming issues of Alpine Karst and the NSS News.
