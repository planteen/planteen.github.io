I spent the weekend of March 1, 2013 at Jackal Hut located between Minturn and
Leadville in Colorado. I snowshoed to the hut from the South Camp Hale
Trailhead using the Ranch Creek trail.

My friend Justin and I pulled a sled with a pony keg full of Ellie’s Brown Ale
from Avery and a turkey on Friday. The loaded sled weighed at least 75 pounds.
This slowed us down considerably and it took 6 hours to reach the hut. My GPS
odometer read 4.6 miles and 2300 vertical feet.

It snowed a foot earlier in the week, but the first part of the trail was well
defined. Snowshoes or skins were a necessity. The snowpack off trail ranged
from firm to extremely weak within the span of a few feet. The lower layers of
snow were faceted which seems typical for the 2012-2013 season in Colorado.

Near the end, the trail became more difficult to find. You want to reach Jackal
Hut from above by climbing the ridge and then descending.

We spent Saturday building a sled run and ramp outside the hut. Great times
were had by all.

The way down on Sunday was much easier, taking an hour and forty-five minutes.

As a note, a 10th Mountain Division hut typically comes stocked with dishes,
silverware, pots, pans, toilet paper, hand sanitizer, paper towels, paper
towels, and axes. It is a good idea to carry a sleeping bag, pillow case, and
slippers for inside the hut.

GPS Waypoints
=============

The website hutski.com has a nice guide and map. I have a few more GPS points
below than they list. Their waypoint for the trailhead was off about 0.2 mi
from where I measured it. The trailhead features a kiosk with a fixed map.
