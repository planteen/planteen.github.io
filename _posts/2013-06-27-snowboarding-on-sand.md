Some friends from Georgia came for a visit and we went to the Great Sand Dunes
National Park. We arrived in Crestone in the afternoon of Friday, June 21,
2013. The town was engulfed in smoke from the raging West Fork Complex fire. We
felt like we were on Mars due to the bizarre colors in the sky from the smoke.

It did lead to one of the most spectacular sunsets I have ever seen.

On Saturday, we went to the dunes. The air was conveniently clear of smoke.
This was my third time sandboarding with a snowboard at the dunes. Here is my
advice for competent snowboarders riding dry sand:

1. Ride as if you are in powder and keep your weight back.
2. Ride the snowboard flat, not on an edge. Keep turns very shallow and subtle.
The edge will dig deeply on a hard turn and sand will collect on the top of
your board. It may seem scary to build up speed on sand, but the dunes
generally have flat run-outs at the bottom. You will stop quickly on the flat
part.
3. Take a straight line down the steepest part of the dune. Speed is your friend in sand.
4. Bring old bindings. Sand will get everywhere in them and make things gritty.
5. If you hike to High Dune, there are three opportunities for good runs on the
way back to the trailhead. The run from the top of High Dune is the longest.
