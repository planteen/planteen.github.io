On Saturday, May 17, 2014, Dave Lambert led a trip in Wind Cave National Park
in South Dakota composed of me (Cody Planteen), Keith Kuhlman, and Michael
Boyes. The primary objective was installing a rescue cache in the Coke Room and
a secondary objective was to complete some cave survey. I only brought a
point-and-shoot digital camera, but I was able to get some decent pictures.

Wind Cave is unlike any other cave I have visited. The parallel passages feel
infinite and boxwork seems to cover every wall. I have never seen boxwork in
another cave and Wind Cave makes it seem more common than stalactites! Many
passages also have spectacular frostwork and moonmilk.

We entered the cave via the elevator to the middle landing and started taking
the yellow and black tourist trail to Rome. From Rome, we took the red and
white trail through the Spillway, Omnibus Hall, and to the Pyramid Room. In the
Pyramid, the rock on the wall looks distinctly like a boot print.

Immediately following the Pyramid Room is the Frostline, an aptly named area
containing spectacular frostwork.

From the Frostline, we continued on through Hobsonâ€™s Choice, switched to the
yellow trail, climbed up the Woodpile, went through the Bayberry Candle Room.
Near the Coke Room, there is fossilized pipe organ coral on the wall!

We reached the Coke Room, where we left the rescue cache and ate a snack. We
then looked at the map to find station KY333 and completed a little survey in
the area.
