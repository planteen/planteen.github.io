Log/antilog tables for GF(256) multiplication
---------------------------------------------

When working with Reed-Solomon codes, log/antilog tables are helpful to
calculate Galois field products by hand. This PDF contains log/antilog tables
for all 16 possible primitive field generating polynomials in GF(256). The
primitive polynomials 0x11D and 0x187 are first since they are most commonly
used for Reed-Solomon codes.
