My name is Cody Planteen. I work for Blue Canyon Technologies in Boulder,
Colorado as a software engineer.

Electricity is dangerous, especially for the untrained. You may damage
electronics. You may hurt or kill yourself. Never underestimate the dangers of
high voltage. This site is not intended to teach electrical safety. Learn
safety in person from someone knowledgeable.

Outdoor activities are inherently dangerous. Never trust a single source of
information. Always dress appropriately and carry essential supplies, including
navigation aids.

Caves are delicate places. Remember the National Speleological Society
conservation motto, "Take nothing but pictures. Kill nothing but time."

I try my best for accuracy, but this site may contain inaccurate, false, or
out-of-date information. By viewing information on this site, you agree to
absolve the author of any liability for injuries or losses incurred.

The opinions expressed on this site are my own. They do not necessarily reflect
